# Misra-Gries Algorithm
Practical Assignment of the Advanced Algorithms course of the Masters in Informatics Engineering of the University of Aveiro.

### Main Goal
The goal is to determine the most frequent items of a dataset, exploring methods that allow processing large datasets. <br>
For this purpose, the Misra & Gries algorithm for frequency estimation was implemented.

### Tasks
As an application, and to analyze the behavior of the developed method, text files of literary works were used, which allows to "simulate" data streams in a simple way. <br>
- Use of the developed method to determine the most frequent letters.
- Comparison of the obtained results with the exact counts.
- Analysis of the influence of the parameters on the results of the computational tests.
